/**
//? Require:
            You can have dynamic loading where the loaded module name isn't predefined /static, or where you conditionally load a module only if it's "truly required" (depending on certain code flow).
            Loading is synchronous. That means if you have multiple requires, they are loaded and processed one by one.

            In NodeJS, require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files.
            require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it,
            and then proceeds to return the export object. require()
            statement not only allows to add built-in core NodeJS modules but also community-based and local modules.

//? ES6 Imports:
            You can use named imports to selectively load only the pieces you need. That can save memory.
            Import can be asynchronous (and in current ES6 Module Loader, it in fact is) and can perform a little better.

            import() & export() statements are used to refer to an ES module.
            Other modules with file types such as .json cannot be imported with these statements.
            They are permitted to be used only in ES modules and the specifier of this statement can 
            either be a URL-style relative path or a package name. Also, the import statement cannot be used
            in embedded scripts unless such script has a type="module". A dynamic import can be used for
            scripts whose type is not “module”

            One of the major differences between require() and import() is that require() can be called from anywhere inside the program whereas 
            import() cannot be called conditionally, it always runs at the beginning of the file.
